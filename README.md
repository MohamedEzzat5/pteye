# Project Overview
I developed a specialized PT-eye app using Flutter, designed to assist physiotherapy patients in performing exercises accurately. The app seamlessly integrates with Firebase and Firestore to provide a secure and collaborative environment. Following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, the app ensures a structured and organized codebase. Implementing the BLoC pattern and Cubit for state management enhances the app's responsiveness and user experience. This project underscores Flutter's versatility in creating a visually appealing and functional interface, fostering correct exercise execution through real-time feedback and collaboration with physiotherapy professionals.
